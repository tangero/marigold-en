post_excerpt: It's hard with podcasts. I don't really like them, I find them informationally
  sparse, you listen to something for an hour and there's not that much valuable information
  to be gained from it. You'd absorb it faster from an article. But in my field of
  interest, there are a lot of podcasts being made and you can't keep track of it.
  So there are services that analyze podcasts and give you a summary.

It's hard with podcasts. I don't really like them, I find them informationally sparse, you listen to something for an hour and there's not that much valuable information to be gained from it. You'd absorb it faster from an article. But in my field of interest, there are a lot of podcasts being made and you can't keep track of it. So there are services that analyze podcasts and give you a summary.

For example, [NoteGPT](https://notegpt.io/podcast-summarizer) has such a service online for English subtitled youtube videos. There are more sophisticated (and paid) services where you subscribe to watch a podcast and every time a new episode comes out, you get an email with a summary of it - and the most interesting ideas. Try [Podsmart](https://www.podsmartai.com/) or [Sumly](https://www.sumly.ai/). For Czech users, there's a pretty significant drawback: it doesn't work with Czech podcasts, it only understands English. But it really makes it easier to watch podcasts that you don't enjoy that much and where you have no idea if an hour of listening will yield anything.

An interesting direction for writers is an app [AutoThread](https://www.autorepurpose.io/), which allows you to take a podcast, analyze it, and prepare a Twitter thread about it. Again, English only.
